# PatchExplainer

This project helps you detect program state differences between the exections of a test on two different versions of a program.

Running PatchExplainer requires the output of [collector-sahab](https://github.com/algomaster99/collector-sahab/) for running the test on the left and right versions of the program. The output of PatchExplainer is the Github Diff augmented with program state diff information.

To obtain the result you have to build the jar file of PatchExplainer (with `mvn package -DskipTests`) and save it as `explainer-cli.jar` and then run the following command:

```
java -jar explainer-cli.jar sdiff --commit {commit-id} --slug {SLUG} --left-report-path {sahabReportDir}/left.json --right-report-path {sahabReportDir}/right.json --left-src-path {oldSrcPath} --right-src-path {newSrcPath} --selected-tests {testName} --test-link {test-link} --output-path {state_diff.html}
```

The command above gets the slug (ex. `khaes-kth/drr-execdiff`), the commit id, the left report generated by collector-sahab, the right report generated by collector-sahab, the path to the old and new java source files, the name and link to the test that has been executed, and the desired path to the html output file.
